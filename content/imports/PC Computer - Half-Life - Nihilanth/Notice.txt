The texture of the Nihilanth's collars and lower section appears as a dark black. This is because Half-Life renders that texture in-game with a unique "chrome" effect that gives off a reflective appearance.

The following steps show how to replicate Half-Life's chrome effect in Blender:

1. Select the chrome_nihilanth material in the Material Properties section of the Properties Editor.
2. Open the chrome_nihilanth material in the Shader Editor.
3. Add the Mapping Node to the Shader Editor. 
4. On the Mapping Node, set both the X and Y parameters in the Location section to 1 m. Also set both the X and Y parameters in the Scale section to 2.0.
5. In addition, set the Vector Type Property to "Texture."
6. Connect the Vector Output on the Mapping Node to the Vector Input on the Base Color Node.
7. Add the Vector Transform Node to the Shader Editor. 
8. On the Vector Transform Node, set the Convert To Property to "Camera."
9. Connect the Vector Output on the Vector Transform Node to the Vector Input on the Mapping Node.
10. Add the Texture Coordinate Node to the Shader Editor. 
11. Connect the Normal Output on the Texture Coordinate Node to the Vector Input on the Vector Transform Node.
